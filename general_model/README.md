## Generalized directional emissivity model
This model generalizes the [Smith 1967][https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/JZ072i016p04059] directional emissivity model to any illumination and observation angle, and adds a new idealized topographic model: a gaussian mixture surface.
